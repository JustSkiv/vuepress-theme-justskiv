## But what exactly is Pipeline??

In Unix-like computer operating systems, a pipeline is a mechanism for inter-process communication
using message passing. A pipeline is a set of processes chained together by their standard streams,
so that the output text of each process (stdout) is passed directly as input (stdin) to the next
one. The second process is started as the first process is still executing, and they are executed
concurrently. The concept of pipelines was championed by Douglas McIlroy at Unix's ancestral home of
Bell Labs, during the development of Unix, shaping its toolbox philosophy.[1][2] It is named by
analogy to a physical pipeline. A key feature of these pipelines is their "hiding of internals" (
Ritchie & Thompson, 1974). This in turn allows for more clarity and simplicity in the system.
